The ridge regression is a possible approach to get a prediction for rent demand. The following diagram shows test data and a prediction curve.
The selected polynomial degree is eight, because the intercept value for this degree was the smallest, 34.4673. The function predicts an hourly demand for
rents. The prediction for 3am goes below zero, that means the company can assume there are no rents expected at this time. This time the company could use for smaller
system adjustments, reboots etc.
