The four bar charts show demand patterns over different time dimensions. The distribution of rides during a single day has two clear peaks,
these are at 8am and at 5pm. Between these hours the demand is more or less equal. After 5pm the demand sinks until 3am where it gets close to
zero. By 4am the demand starts rising again. The reason for this kind of distribution is the people's daily routine. At roughly 8am there is the
first rush hour where people get to work, university, school etc. During the daytime, people have a demand for the bicycles as they need to get to
a certain destination in the city. Later, at 5pm, the second rush hour occurs. This is explained by the almost equal end of the work
day for almost all people. After that, hour by hour the demand sinks as people are getting home and most likely dont leave the house until the next
morning. During the night, Boston seems to be a quiet place. People sleep at night and don't use the bikes.

The distribution over weekdays shows that there is a clear difference between the work days Monday to Friday and the weekend days, Saturday and Sunday.
On weekend days people use to leave the city or take their cars.

The distribution of rides per month shows clearly a demand growth from January to September. As the fall begins the demand drops rapidly. The lowest
demand can be observed during the winter months and the highest over the summer months and September.

An additional distribution with rides per calendar week is a refinement of the demands per month. It has the same development and form as the previous
bar chart.

The gained data and visual information helps a bike sharing company to understand the development of demand over time and to make right conclusions
and decisions regarding fleet maintenance and demand prediction.
