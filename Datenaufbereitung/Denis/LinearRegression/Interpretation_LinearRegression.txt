Linear Regression On Temperature And Rents Per Hour

In terms of predicting the demand a possible idea is to find a correlation between outdoor temperatures and hourly values for the rents.
The first step is to generate a dataset with weather and rents combined. Therefore we take the previous generated dataset for the KPI
total rents per hour and left-join it on the temperature data for 2019. After cleaning the data it is a good idea to also have a look if precipitation
has an impact on the temerature-rents correlation. As shown in the plot below, the blue points for the days with precipitation do not reveal any special
patterns. This means it is not neccessary to do two separate regression models. The resulting function is f(t) = 0.3751*t - 0.0353 (Values rounded to 4th digit)
where t is the rescaled temperature and f(t) is the predicted rescaled demand. The function describes very well the average demand per temperature but does not
give a precise prediction for specific values. There is an interesting point at f(t) = 0 where t is (approx.) 0.094. As there is no possibility to have negative
rents it turns out that below t = 0.094 there are no rents expected. If this value is rescaled back we get (approx.) -10.2°C. If temperatures drop lower than this
value the bike sharing company could expect that nobody will rent the bikes. This information is very useful and valuable as the company can use those days with
low outdoor temperatures to maintain the fleet, change bikes or do other related adjustments. As the regression coefficient is positive there is a positive linear
correlation between the outdoor temperatures and amount of rents. The drawback is that the linear regression is not a precise predictor for demand as it can only
predict an average for temperatures and the real values variate too much from the linear regression function. Also there is a difference between 15°C in summer
and in winter, this is not observed in the regression.
