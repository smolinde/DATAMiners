Handling Missing Data

To ensure that the dataset has no huge information lacks it is a good idea to go through every single hour and find out if for this particular hour the dataset provides rent informations. The script 'MissingHours.ipynb' focuses on this task. The result is shown in the diagram 'Missing Data'. There are 60 hours missing over the whole dataset. This is roughly 0.68% of data that is missing, so a very insignificant amount. There are three days that have more missing hours than the others - 20.01.2019 to 22.01.2019. The 20th January is missing completely and the other two days have six and four hours missing. This occured probably due a system malfunction or a planned maintenance day. The other affected days have, as shown in the second diagram, missing values for hours 00:00 to 05:00. This can be simply explained by the fact that on these days no rents were started in the night. This means that probably even less than 0.68% of the whole data is missing.
